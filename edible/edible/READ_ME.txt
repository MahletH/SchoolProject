How the system works:
    -an admin creates a restaurant, giving it a manager and creating a password and username for the manager to use.
    -use username='admin' and password='pass' to log in as an admin, then access the website through the manager's
     perspective with the accounts/restaurants your create
    -sign up as a user and log in 

P.S.:
    -at times, the basic html structure loads before the CSS.
